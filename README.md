# SDP for One-shot Dilution of Quantum Coherence

This project contains codes for the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08876).

All computational functions are implemented in individual `.mlx` files, with experimental data and plotting code located in the `test.mlx` file, which also serves as the main file.

This project utilizes the [CVX](https://cvxr.com/cvx/) package, and since CVX is licensed under the GPLv3 agreement, this project also adopts that license.
